<h2>What is debate?</h2>
<p style="text-indent:20px">
A debate is a verbal argument that is conducted within a set framework. Debates are common in both political and educational environments. People can disagree with opposing views in a structured setting that gives all participants a chance to present and defend their arguments as well as reach conclusions about the arguments of their opponents. There are many different formats possible for a debate, but debates also have many features in common.</p>

    <title>What is a Debate? (with pictures)</title>  
<p style="text-indent:20px">
    The topic of a debate can be virtually anything. However, most debates with a public audience center around a controversial issue that has interest for the audience such as the topic of gun control, for example. Some debates have audience participation with some questions posed by the audience to the debaters. Debates may involve one participant against another or they may be in a team format. Basic debate formats vary widely in terms of time limits for speeches, the order of speeches and how arguments are presented.
